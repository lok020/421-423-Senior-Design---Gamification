You find a toppled over bag of seeds.
You: So that's why there were plants growing everywhere.
You: Are these even edible? Maybe they bear fruit.
You pick up the bag and dust it off and notice a piece of paper that was underneath the bag.
You: What's this?
You pick up the paper.
You: Pretty dirty. Still readable though.
You: The top reads 'For Your Eyes Only!'
You: That's an odd title.
You: "Wait! I can read this?!"
You: The paper is written in my language. You quickly begin reading.
'If you have found this, then you must be finally up. It is I, the Arch Wizard. You know me but you may not remember.'
'If you wish to learn the secrets of this world and yourself, continue. Be warned, there is a reason you do not remember.'
'It was you who did not wish to know. But if you ever do wish, continue on. You will find your answer in your search.'
The page ends.
You: I know the Arch Wizard? There is a secret to this world? I erased my own memories?
You: This is a lot to take in. Should I ask the villagers?
You: The first line says it's only for my eyes. But that doesn't mean I can't tell them right?
You gain a feeling of excitement and yet fear.
You: I'll think over this later. I have to get out. The vines look like they're creeping towards me.
