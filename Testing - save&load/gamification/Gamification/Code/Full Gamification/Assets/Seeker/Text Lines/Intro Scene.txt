You: Man what a long day. It's only 6 and it's already dark.
You: I really hope I get the job. I think the interview went pretty well.
You: It seemed that I was the very last one to finish being interviewed. There were a lot of people applying there today.
You: I guess that's only natural seeing as to how big the company has grown in so little time.
You: The company, Formed Fiction, specializes in VR technology. It started off with only a small group of friends just two years ago. Now it's a world wide company worth billions.
You: Their VR tech they've created is state of the art with the ability to force signals to fire off in the brain allowing the user to be unable to distinguish between reality and virtual reality.
You: The only downside is the quality of game for this tech to completely immerse the player is still far off. There have been a few attempts but the graphics would always look off.
You: I was asked to try out one of their VR sets during the interview. I guess that they wanted to judge how well I can give feedback on their products.
You: It looked like their latest VR set but instead it was attatched to a very large computer.
You: Since the VR system directs signals in the brain directly, people don't, or more properly can't, stand while playing it and requires the user to lay down.
You: They actually state that the user shouldn't operate heavy machinery after using the system so I had to take this train back home. They paid for the two way ticket so I could get back tomorrow for my car.
You: "The VR system took a bit of a toll on my eyes. It seems there's still a little while away so I guess I'll close my eyes for a bit.."
