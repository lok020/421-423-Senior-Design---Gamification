Me: "Wow... That... Was... A lot... Higher... Than I realized."
Me: Oh I probably should've brought a weapon in case I was attacked.
Me: Well can't turn back now.  It'll be dark by the time I get back here.
Me: Also I'll probably die of a heart attack...

Me: Can't turn back now. Gotta go to the dungeon.

Me: Ugh... That training took a toll on me... How do they expect me to understand all that in such short time?
Me: And this hill... I'm going to die of starvation before I can get back.
Me: This dungeon better not glitch again and scam me of my food.
Me: Well whatever. To the cave we go again... Yay....

Me: I can't turn back now. I need food and so does everyone else.
