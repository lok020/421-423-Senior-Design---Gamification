Okay this is weird. Let's see let's see... Draw knowledge from decades of gaming...
Ahh this is one of those "wake up in another world" scenerios right??
Alright so if that's the case someone should come and find me soon...

Okay maybe not.
Let's see...
I'm in a forest. There's a dirt path in front of me. I still have my laptop bag. Behind me is..
What is that? A dungeon?
Ooh this is one of those RPG settings right?
I wonder what's in it.

I should check out the cave first.

Hmm it's too dark. I don't think I should go in.
Guess I'll see where this path takes me. It should be an exit. I hope there aren't any bears around...
Actually. Now that I think about it, there hasn't been any sound at all.
If I'm really in a forest then shouldn't there be birds chirping or twigs snapping?
Odd. Guess deforestation is working.

It's too dark. Maybe I'll come back later.

Finally an opening.
Oh looks like I'm on high ground. Lucky!
Let's see what's ahead.

I think I see something!
It looks like a town!
Damn this cliff is too steep to climb. Gotta look for another way.

I should look over the cliff. Maybe there's something out there.
