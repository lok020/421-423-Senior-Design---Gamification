You: Wow. What a blatantly important house.
You turn the door handle.
To your mild surprise, it's unlocked.
You: There's no harm in entering an unlocked house in an abandoned village right?
You: Right?
You enter anyway.

You pass through the empty residential area and into the town market square.
You: What a nice morning. Really fresh air as well.
You notice a villager standing in front of a shop.
You: I think that's the village chef. Perfect! They'll definitely be able to whip me up something!
You: Actually I wonder what kind of food they even have...
You: Whatever. As long as it fills me up.

As you enter the castle grounds, you notice the village leader basking in the sun by some flowers.
You: I guess they're having breakfast.
The village leader hasn't noticed you yet.
