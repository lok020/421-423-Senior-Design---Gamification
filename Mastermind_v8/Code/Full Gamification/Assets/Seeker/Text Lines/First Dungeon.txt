You: I can't leave yet. I need to look around.

You: No monsters sighted so far. That's good. I should still be cautious though.

First trap hit
You: Whoa! That was way too close!
You: A pit fall? Who builds a pit fall underground??
You: It's not too deep of a pit. I think I can fill enough of it with dirt around to make it safe.

You: There we go. I gotta be careful from now on. Who knows what other traps there might be around here.

Notice pressure plate
You: Ha! A pressure plate! Won't get me this time!
You stand back and use the base of the staff to activate the trap

A pillar crashes down from the ceiling and destroys the bottom of the staff. It rises back up as quickly as it fell down.
You: WHOA WHOA WHOA! I could have been flattened there!
You: Crap. The bottom of the staff broke. I guess I have a wand now. The light still works though. 
You: I can't trigger any more traps like I just did though. I have to be extremely careful and dodge the traps.
You: I wonder if I can disable this trap somehow... I'll just avoid it for now. I don't want to trigger it again.
Move player forward. Don't allow player to go back.

You: Can't do anything about it right now. Gotta keep moving forward.

Player gets to people.
You: Whoa.
You: I"ve been saying whoa a lot…

Player gets closer
You: Whoa. What are these? So many crystals! Am I rich?? Well I couldn't buy anything with these without a store though.
You: Wait. There's a dark shadow inside. Hmm. My light doesn't show much detail but… It looks like a person figure inside. All of these seem to have a shadow in them now that I look closely!
You: Oh these must be the villagers! I have to free them! Let's try touching the crystals.

You: Nope. Hmm…
You: Ahh let's try the light crystal!

You: What the. They're stick figures… Oh god have I summoned demons??
???: фhiK@Щ@gfft@vbДЋfwДЋK@дbhf@qЋ@ГibГ@ИwДo
You: They're looking at me… Should I run? No if I run I might trigger a trap I may have missed.
You: I guess I'll try to communicate.
You: "Hello! I am friend. Not foe."
???: %шwД}f@vwГ@Гif@ubhfK@цiw@bf@ИwДo@Щ@Жwvef@qg@ГifИ@ДvefЋГbve@ДЋK
You: "Uhh. I don't understand. Do you know what I am saying? I have come from far away."
You: Maybe they are the villagers.
???: %Щ@hДfЋЋ@vwГK@ТДГ@Гibvs@ИwД@gw@fЋdДqvh@ДЋK
One of the beings points to light crystal.
You: They're pointing at this jewel.
You: "Oh this? Sorry I borrowed it from a house to get in here."
One of the beings reaches out their hands.
You: Oh no they're gonna kill me!
It shakes your hand.
You: Ahhh they're gonna tear me apart limb to limb!
You: Wait… A handshake?
???: %цf@vffe@Гw@gqve@Гif@fЗqГK
It lets go and points to exit.
You: "Uhh. Yeah I came from there. But there are traps."
They look confused.
You: I guess they don't understand me as well. I guess I'll mime what I mean.
Gestures a plate on the ground and something falling from the ceiling.
The beings all make a sound in unison.
You: Do they understand?
One of them points to the ground and scratches head
You: Ground lice? No. Oh they might want to know where the trap is!
You gesture villagers to follow.

Go to pillar trap
You: The way they walk is really...scary.
You point to the pressure plate and then to the ceiling
You: There it is.
The villagers talk between each other. One villager walks up to the trap.
It messes around with the pressure plate.

The villager removes the plate and tosses it aside.
You: What.
The villagers gestures to continue.
You: Alrighty then. I guess we're good to go!
