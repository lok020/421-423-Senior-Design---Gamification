Whoa this has a mideival vibe to it.
The stone roads, castle walls.
But where is everyone?
Hmm. Still don't hear anything. I guess I should see if they're inside these buildings.

Seems like this is the only house unlocked.
You: Hello? Is anyone here?

Guess not.
There's a fire going. So the owners must not have been gone for too long.
Man this feels wrong going into a stranger's home without permission.
(Grrrrr)
Ugh I haven't eaten all day. Or who knows how long I've been asleep. I guess I'll look around for some food.
