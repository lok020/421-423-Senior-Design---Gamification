You: Whoa this has a midieval vibe to it.
You: The stone roads, castle walls.
You: But where is everyone?
You: Hmm. Still don't hear anything. I guess I should see if they're inside these buildings.

You look around real quick before closing the door behind you.
You: Hello? Is anyone here?

You: Guess not.
You: There's a fire going. So the owners must not have been gone for too long.
You: Man this feels wrong going into a stranger's home without permission.
You: *Gurgle...*
You: Ugh I haven't eaten all day. Or who knows how long I've been asleep. I guess I'll look around for some food.

You: It's locked. There should be a key around though.

You find a key in this cabinet.
You: This probably goes into the chest by the bed.

You: There we go!
You: Wow. What's this? A staff with a white jewel at the end of it. Reminds me of a wizard's staff
You wave it around.
You: Whoa! It lights up! Man, that's bright.
You: Anything else in this chest? Nope. I guess this is my starting item.
You: What to do with it... Right there's that dungeon near where I woke up.
You: That sounds like the right place to go. I really hope I don't run into anything in there...
You: I guess I'll store my laptop bag in here for now. I don't want to damage it in case I can use it later.
